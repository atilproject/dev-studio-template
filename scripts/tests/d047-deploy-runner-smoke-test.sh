# d047-deploy-runner-smoke-test.sh — regression test for ADR-0101 deploy-runner
# healthz smoke-test contract.
#
# Why this test exists
# --------------------
# ADR-0101 §Decision.4 requires deploy-runner.sh to perform a healthz smoke test
# after restart + assert `git_sha == GITHUB_SHA`. The smoke test must:
#   - Hit the configured HEALTHZ_PATH on the configured DEPLOY_PORT
#   - Parse JSON response, extract `git_sha` field
#   - Pass if actual_sha == GITHUB_SHA, fail if mismatch
#   - Retry SMOKE_ATTEMPTS times with SMOKE_RETRY_DELAY_SEC between attempts
#   - On final failure: rollback to HEAD@{1} + restart + retry once
#   - On double-failure: page owner via scripts/notify.sh -l human
#
# Lens f (observability) and lens e (idempotency rollback) are the decisive
# concerns. Without this test, the smoke-test logic can silently regress.
#
# This test uses a mock healthz server (Python http.server) on a temp port.
# It does NOT require a real systemd unit or a real git repo.
#
# Sister test: atilcan65/AtilCalculator scripts/deploy-runner.sh v9.1
#   (the live production version; template d047 is the standalone regression)
#
# Test cases (per ADR-0101 §Decision.4 smoke-test contract, 6 TCs):
#   T1: deploy-runner.sh --dry-run prints smoke-test step in DRY-RUN output
#   T2: deploy-runner.sh exits 0 in --dry-run when smoke-test would pass
#   T3: deploy-runner.sh smoke-test step references HEALTHZ_URL env var
#   T4: deploy-runner.sh smoke-test step references GITHUB_SHA assertion
#   T5: deploy-runner.sh rollback path is invoked on smoke-test failure
#   T6: deploy-runner.sh double-failure path pages owner (notify.sh call)
#
# Exit code: 0 = all pass, 1 = at least one fail.
#
# Run standalone: bash scripts/tests/d047-deploy-runner-smoke-test.sh
